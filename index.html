          <p>The other day I saw a on tweet from Dennis Gaebel, from  <a href="grayghostvisuals.com">grayghostvisuals.com</a>, who wanted to give back to community by offering mentoring. For a while I had been looking to learn from someone better than me, so I jumped at the opportunity. </p>

<p>A couple of days before I had bumbed into his website, and knew that like me, he does both, design and development. I think our interests align really well in web development topics like SVG-animations and interaction design, so Dennis seemed like a good choice for a mentor! He has also done fantastic job in the form of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/polylion/">polylion</a> which was featured on CSS-tricks.com and got me following him on twitter in the first place.</p>

<p>I have always been working as either the lead designer, or among peers of similar skill level, so I had never gotten much advice from senior designers. So to me, this was excellent opportunity to get the design critique from a more experienced and skilled designer.</p>

<p>I took the chance and tweeted him back "Where does one apply?"</p>

<p>Dennis replied, we got to talking, exchanged a few e-mails and now I officially have mentor, which I'm super stoked about! Thanks Dennis for mentoring me! </p>

<p>Already after a few days Dennis has already given me valuable feedback on my designs, as well as public presence, open source projects, and introduced me to <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">GSAP</a>, the JavaScript animation framework. He also kindly invited me to Dribbble, where you can expect to see my <a href="dribbble.com/modipeluri">debut shot</a> soon.</p>

<p>For my part I can say that I'm really looking forward to learning from Dennis, and hopefully occasionally be able to give something back to him. I think it's going to be a tremendous help to get design validation and advice for your design decisions when in doubt. In general, I feel that this whole mentor-mentee thing gets you to think more about design/development related topics.</p>
