          <p>The other day I saw a feed on twitter from Dennis Gaebel, from  <a href="grayghostvisuals.com">grayghostvisuals.com</a>, who wanted to give back to community by offering mentoring. For a while I had been looking to learn from someone better than me, so I jumped at the opportunity. A couple of days previously I had checked his website, and knew what his work was about. He has also done fantastic job in the form of <a href="polylion">https://css-tricks.com/polylion/</a> which got me following him on twitter in the first place.</p>

<p>I had always been working as either the lead designer, or among peers of similar skill level, so I had never gotten much advice from senior designers. For me, this was excellent opportunity to get a chance to learn from that experience first-hand.</p>

<p>I took the chance and tweeted him back "Where does one apply?"</p>

<p>Dennis replied, we got to talking, exchanged a few e-mails and now I officially have mentor, which I'm super stoked about! Thanks Dennis for mentoring me! Already after a few days Dennis has already given me valuable feedback on my designs, as well as public presence, open source projects, and introduced me to <a href="GSAP">http://greensock.com/gsap</a>, the JavaScript animation framework. He also kindly invited me to Dribbble, where you can expect to see my <a href="debut%20shot">dribbble.com/modipeluri</a> soon.</p>

<p>For my part I can say that I'm really looking forward to learning from Dennis, and hopefully occasionally be able to give something back to him. I think it's going to be a tremendous help to get design validation and advice for your design decisions when in doubt. In general, I feel that this whole mentor-mentee thing gets you to think more about design/development related topics.</p>
