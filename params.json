{"name":"Modipeluri.GitHub.io","tagline":"I have a mentor!","body":"The other day I saw a on tweet from Dennis Gaebel, from  [grayghostvisuals.com](grayghostvisuals.com), who wanted to give back to community by offering mentoring. For a while I had been looking to learn from someone better than me, so I jumped at the opportunity. \r\n\r\nA couple of days before I had bumbed into his website, and knew that like me, he does both, design and development. I think our interests align really well in web development topics like SVG-animations and interaction design, so Dennis seemed like a good choice for a mentor! He has also done fantastic job in the form of [polylion](https://css-tricks.com/polylion/) which was featured on CSS-tricks.com and got me following him on twitter in the first place.\r\n\r\nI have always been working as either the lead designer, or among peers of similar skill level, so I had never gotten much advice from senior designers. So to me, this was excellent opportunity to get the design critique from a more experienced and skilled designer.\r\n\r\nI took the chance and tweeted him back \"Where does one apply?\"\r\n\r\nDennis replied, we got to talking, exchanged a few e-mails and now I officially have mentor, which I'm super stoked about! Thanks Dennis for mentoring me! \r\n\r\nAlready after a few days Dennis has already given me valuable feedback on my designs, as well as public presence, open source projects, and introduced me to [GSAP](http://greensock.com/gsap), the JavaScript animation framework. He also kindly invited me to Dribbble, where you can expect to see my [debut shot](dribbble.com/modipeluri) soon.\r\n\r\nFor my part I can say that I'm really looking forward to learning from Dennis, and hopefully occasionally be able to give something back to him. I think it's going to be a tremendous help to get design validation and advice for your design decisions when in doubt. In general, I feel that this whole mentor-mentee thing gets you to think more about design/development related topics.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.grayghostvisuals.com/advice/mentoring/(Read about Dennis' thoughts on mentoring here)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
